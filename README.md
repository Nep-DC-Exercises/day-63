### Summary

We were introduced to Storybook which seems like an interesting technology to rapidly tweak UI elements based on various states.

I could really see this come in handy in some sort of agency type setting where you can create stories to ship out to your client who can then tweak colors and other styles to their liking in an easy 'no-code' type of way.
